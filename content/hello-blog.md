Decided to make a blog so that I can document things and I feel like I don't write enough stuff. So here it is.

I wanted to keep it as simple as possible, so going to [the root](https://blog.gu3.me/) will take you straight to a list of
posts.
Pages can be linked to [like this](https://blog.gu3.me/hello-blog).
The blog has support for stuff like code blocks, video, etc... just in case I ever need those.
It's currently just built in nuxt with like, the simplest code ever. Hopefully having it fully server-sided won't make it
slow as hell.

I also decided that I should probably keep posts short and sweet, making them short reads and wasting as little time as
possible both writing them & for people reading, so don't expect 1000-word essays or whatever.
