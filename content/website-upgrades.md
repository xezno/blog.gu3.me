description: I made some changes to my website.

I moved [my website](https://gu3.me/) from SCSS to Tailwind yesterday, where it looked exactly the same - and then I got
working on an improved layout because I decided Tailwind was pretty good.

The website now has a bit more information about what I'm capable of, and fetches the latest three blog posts.

There are a few more things I plan on adding at some point, but this is what the main section of the website looks like now:

![website 2.0](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/839155256964284459/839882613548384266/unknown.png)

It's slightly more colourful, but I'm not sure about the colour scheme I chose. Colour theory is hard.
