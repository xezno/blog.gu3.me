description: Here's some ramblings about the future of s&box.

Earlier today I hit 1000 hours in s&box.

So I thought I'd weigh in with my two cents about where s&box is, where I think it's going, and why I think it needs to change.

Let me preface this by saying that s&box is great, I love it - to be honest, I think that overall s&box is heading in a great direction. Right now, s&box is in a pretty good state API-wise, tools-wise, etc. - most things are super-obvious even without documentation because IntelliSense is great and you can just type what you want and you'll get it, and the tools are super easy to use.
This is more of a post outlining various concerns I have regarding the platform right now. And please note that I don't hate anyone. I love Facepunch devs and s&box devs alike - you're all great ❤️.

That being said, If you're not prepared for criticism or suggestions or whatever, I advise you to just ignore this post and carry on with your life.

So first off, my main concern is visibility. Roblox has it really bad, where it seems like the same few "experiences" constantly rotate and no other experience on there gets a chance to shine - which sucks because there's definitely a load of hidden gems on there that are just waiting for people to find them.
S&box is a bit better, but still not great. With the menu in its current state, it's going to be hard to find stuff (harder than it already is - I'll get on to this later) which means that people are going to be missing out on a lot of fun games.

In addition to visibility, right now we're in a bit of a "forking crisis" (intentional pun?). What I mean by this is that every other gamemode being put on the platform seems to be a fork of the sandbox (Garry's Mod 2) gamemode rather than being anything actually unique or original. Here's what I mean by that:

My point with this is that people are going to buy the game, see this shit, and then probably end up refunding it after they realize that the advertised "games" are the same fucking experience with a slight change each time. It's gotten to the point where it's a genuine concern within the s&box "circle" / sub-community I'm involved in - we still have hopes that the game will have a menu capable of curating high-quality content, but right now we're not seeing that. And there's no point in us making unique, quality content if that's not going to be the case.

These issues don't leave me with much hope - especially if they're to be supporting this for the next decade or two and especially if it's going to pay off for me at all. It hasn't left some other people with much hope either - I've had a few people tell me, after raising these points with them, that they've "checked out of s&box" and that they don't want much involvement with it unless this changes.

**tl;dr** - I'm hoping we get addons soon-ish so that we can purge the disgusting sandbox fork spam on the gamemodes page
