So over the past few years a load of AAA titles have released and they've all sucked. And here's why.
I'm going to focus on the main AAA releases from the last couple of months, but I think you'll get the gist of what I'm
saying and see how it can be applied to most recent AAA games.

## Battlefield 2042

Battlefield 2042 is fucking dog shit. On one hand, you don't want a new entry to be the same as the last title, but the stupid
fuckers at EA/DICE decided "hey, let's just start removing features". And they did this because they decided to upgrade to a
new "version" of Frostbite that required everything to be re-written. So they probably sat there with a load of junior devs
over the course of a year just re-writing the systems they already had, and I'm not even sure why. The new engine is utter
shite. The game looks worse than BFV. It doesn't have the atmosphere of BF1. It doesn't have the physics / destruction of BF4.
So what the fuck does the new version of the engine even bring? It does nothing. They sat there re-writing system after system,
cutting features from some systems, cutting some systems out entirely, and there's absolutely nothing to show for it, because
Battlefield 2042 isn't even close to being a "complete" experience.

So why did they do this, why does the game suck so hard? It's because management brought in a load of newbies, told them
to re-write every core Battlefield system, and then pushed them out the door as soon as they got comfortable with the
Frostbite tooling. And instead of actually spending time on features that made sense gameplay-wise, management told them to
spend time on features that would bring in cash.

## Halo: Infinite

Halo's multiplayer isn't that bad. But the microtransactions are, and there's places where the game doesn't feel right. Oh, and
they also spent like, 6 years releasing it, and I'm pretty sure it was in development hell at one point (it got so bad that
mid-development they spent months wondering if they should just restart using the Unreal Engine, apparently). But it's another case
of shit management - the devs working on Infinite were contract devs. They probably spent 12 or 18 months there, got comfortable
with the tooling, then got told to fuck off so they could be replaced with more inexperienced devs. And management probably told
them to spend more time on shitty microtransaction features or battle pass features instead of the actual gameplay.

## Call of Duty: Vanguard

It's the same as MW19 but with a different theme, same gameplay, same everything. So who gives a shit, why even buy this game
when you get the exact same experience with the game they brought out 2 years ago. Fucking bonkers. Yearly releases are going
to kill the COD franchise.

But - it's another management thing. The developers don't sit there and go, "oh, for the next 3 years I am going to sit
here and do nothing but swap some assets around". They probably WANT to make new features and new cool things, but management
wants to "play it safe" so they can rake in as much as possible.

# Management

So, what does all this mean what does it all boil down to? Shitty management. If you're a manager, and you're reading this
for whatever reason: make sure your priorities are straight. If it was me, I'd focus on fun and gameplay. Because people 
don't want to play a game that isn't fun, so they're not going to spend money on shit that isn't fun either. Make something
you want to play, something that comes from the heart.
